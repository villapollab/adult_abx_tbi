## Antibiotic treatment induces microbiome dysbiosis and reduction of neuroinflammation following traumatic brain injury in mice.
Code base used to decipher relationships between TBI, antibiotics, and the gut microbiome.

We used short-read 16S sequencing, long-read metagenomic sequencing, and targeted metabolomics to research the impact of these injuries and treatment on the gut microbiome.

If you are interested in the code used for the analysis of the microbiome we have an extensive [documentation](https://villapollab.github.io/adult_abx_tbi/) page that walks through every bit of our data processing and is a good resource for anyone looking to perform microbiome characterization on their own data as well.
