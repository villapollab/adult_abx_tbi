Warning - 9 input sequences aligned poorly to reference sequences (--min_align option specified a minimum proportion of 0.8 aligning to reference sequences). These input sequences will not be placed and will be excluded from downstream steps.

This is the set of poorly aligned input sequences to be excluded: 91bed4fdf1ea73c6a991f458fc639f25, 44b582605ec7b1d365e3c75fd1d840a6, 19bd9754f909f637eeb2f21661eb79df, b36efa2ff189af8206a40c128898e3f5, ce93ff3b9e0e4acfdee378c307cda961, 78c46695b2f961616eddf069fd153b60, a98bbf59d945110155ea762359266492, bbe678af042d678cd01c09ed18297234, fa22a31c3a1dffa25bdd0ad425ea9fc9





2 of 2467 ASVs were above the max NSTI cut-off of 2.0 and were removed from the downstream analyses.
